    "This is a simple example of a baseline RAG application which purpose is to answer questions about the fantasy series [Malazan Universe](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Malazan_Wiki) created by Steven Erikson and Ian C. Esslemont.\n",
    "\n",
    "First the example will show each step of a baseline RAG pipeline including **Indexing**, **Retrieval** and **Generation**. This is done in order to show the architecture without the abstraction provided by frameworks like LlamaIndex and LangChain.\n",
    "Then a more \"normal\" example will be shown using LlamaIndex.\n",

      " You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about the US tv show of \"The Office\" using provided context.\n",
      "    Context information is below.\n",
      "    ---------------------\n",
      "    Later, when Jim believes Angela stole his baby and he yells out for someone to stop her from leaving the church, Kevin grabs her purse, believing the baby to be stored in there, but instead finds what he thinks to be \"thousands\" of scones Angela stole from reception.\n",
      "In \"Viewing Party\", when the office is watching a live broadcast of the SWAT surrounding the Scranton Strangler's house, he thinks they \"should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out\". Kevin also sets Michael down his jealous path when he refers to Gabe as the boss. Later, at the viewing party, he climbs into Gabe's bed with a plate of \"pigs in a blanket\" hors d'oeuvres and pulls the covers over himself, since he wants to try \"pigs in a blanket\" while under a blanket.\n",
      "In the beginning of \"WUPHF.com\", when the office's computer servers go temporarily down, and everyone is trying to remember the password, Kevin suggests \"Big Boobs\". (It is revealed to be, as suggested by Dwight, \"big boobz\".) Later, Jim learns through Kevin that he maxed out his commission's cap (although, at first, Kevin believes there's something wrong with his computer since he entered the sale in while doing \"dunh-duh-na-dah!\"). Kevin also gets lost in the \"Hay Place\" maze.\n",
      "In \"China\", when Michael demands big ideas to stop China's growing power, Kevin comes up with the idea of an antacid you only take once a week. Michael then asks for any better ideas, and Kevin suggests an antacid you only take every six weeks, causing Stanley to sarcastically ask why not go for a full year, causing Kevin to answer that then it would be too big a pill to swallow. Kevin soon teases Oscar after it turns out Michael was right and he was wrong in a conversation about China's population. Later, Dwight asks Kevin what he would think would make the office building a better place, since he's putting together a \"wish list\". Kevin then wishes for a million wishes, where Dwight informs him he's not a genie, causing Kevin to tell the \"building\" to get lost.\n",
      "In the cold open of \"Classy Christmas\", when Michael is trying to decide what everyone should do in the Christmas group photo, Kevin suggests the men and women be separated, and the men should stand in a \"why I oughta\" pose, while the women stand in a \"let's go shopping\" pose, but his idea is quickly rejected. In the episode, Kevin shows that he is not impressed that Angela's boyfriend is a state senator, and it is hinted Kevin does not know what a comptroller is. When Pam asks for volunteers to come with her to buy a Christmas tree, Kevin declines, saying he doesn't want to get dirty in case any girls show up at the party, leading Pam to berate him to stop thinking that, since no one ever invites other women. When Holly arrives, Kevin is obviously upset that she ate half of the maple candies she brought for the office. After Holly confronts the staff over who threw her Woody doll in the trash, Kevin comes up with the theory that, since Toy Story is about toys coming alive when nobody's around, Woody came alive and threw himself in the garbage.\n",
      "In \"Ultimatum\", Holly raises up her ring fingers to show that she is not engaged, but Kevin misunderstands and calls her a \"bitch\" while giving her \"the finger\". Kevin's new year resolution he puts on Pam's \"New Year's Resolution Board\" is for him to eat more vegetables. Later, in the conference room, Michael, upset that Holly didn't stick to her ultimatum that if AJ didn't propose to her she would dump him, projects his anger onto the rest of the office for not sticking to their resolutions, and forces Kevin to eat a stalk of broccoli. While at first, Kevin is glad Michael is making him stick to his resolution, he soon finds it very difficult eating it. He starts eating it stem-first (since it's a \"new food\" for him and he doesn't know how else he should eat it), but soon begs Michael to allow him to put \"Cheese Whiz\" or hollandaise on it, but Michael forces him to eat it plain. Kevin is so disgusted though, that he hides it under his tongue and eventually spits it out. Kevin is soon called into Michael's office, where Michael apologizes for his actions. Kevin tells him that he means no offense, but Michael needs to get his life.\n",

Kevin tells him that he means no offense, but Michael needs to get his life. Michael says he's right and he hopes they can still be friends, which causes Kevin to readily forgive him and gives him a big, crushing hug while saying he's going to \"help\" Michael with his problems. Shortly afterward, Kevin defaces Ryan's resolution to \"Live life like an art project\" by writing an \"F\" in front of the word \"art\". While Ryan uses the incident in the conference room as a comeback, Kevin still mocks Ryan and makes a farting noise, only to embarrassingly pass gas for real.\n",
      "In \"The Seminar\", Kevin is one of the workers Andy asks to help him out in the seminar. When Kevin begins his presentation, he runs around the conference room while \"Crazy Train\" is played, causing him to get exhausted and throw up.\n",
      "In \"The Search\", when Pam presents her drawing of two dogs on a desert island, Kevin believes that it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island (instead of just an incredibly tiny island).\n",
      "In \"PDA\", Michael and Holly's public displays of affection make Kevin \"horny\". In a meeting about Public Displays of Affection, Dwight reads a list of names of employees who have had sex in the office, and Kevin adds his own name to the list, but Angela, doubting that he has, asks with who, only for Kevin to state that \"she goes to another school\". When Michael is worried that Holly might break up with him again, Kevin does a \"monkey face\" in an attempt to cheer him up. After Michael and Holly announce that they're moving in together and Oscar encourages them to kiss, Kevin says \"Suck on that, Oscar\" even though he was the one who told them to kiss.\n",
      "In \"Threat Level Midnight\", Kevin is in Michael's movie of the same name as \"Hostage #3\".\n",
      "In \"Todd Packer\", Kevin is excited when he learns Todd Packer will be working at the office full-time, but Todd later insults him for the fun of it. Kevin tries to pretend he's fine with it, but is obviously hurt. Michael later calls Kevin up in front of the office so Packer can apologize to him. Kevin claims he wasn't offended, but Michael still makes Packer say he's sorry, although the apology is very insincere. In this episode, Kevin also states to the camera that he has very little patience for stupidity.\n",
      "In \"Garage Sale\", Kevin sells a Dallas board game at the warehouse garage sale. Kevin, Andy and Darryl play and bet on the game, but the instruction booklet is not with the game, so Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection. Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy look at each other in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras that he has the money, stating, \"And that... is Dallas\", mocking Andy and Darryl's previous statement.\n",
      "In \"Training Day\" Kevin Wears a toupee to impress the new boss, Deangelo Vickers. He tells him that he \"hates bald people.\" Later, when Michael passes out mini peanut butter sandwiches, he tosses one to Kevin, who catches it in his mouth.\n",
      "In \"Goodbye, Michael\", Michael's going-away present to Kevin is a caricature of Kevin as a pig sloppily eating a pizza. Michael rips it up and tells Kevin that he will be thin and he will find love. Kevin informs him that he's okay with who he is now, but Michael tells him he should never settle for that. When Michael is questioned on what town in Colorado Holly's parents live in, he answers \"Mountainton\", which Kevin says sounds beautiful. At lunch, Kevin says that he does not like the shredder at the office, saying that it won't shred magazines, implying that he broke the shredder trying to shred whole magazines.\n",
